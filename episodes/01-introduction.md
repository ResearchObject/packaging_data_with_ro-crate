follow_up_training: []
questions:
- How do I package data in a FAIR way?
- How can I list the authors of individual files?
- Can I use multiple licenses in the same data package?
- How can I visualize JSON-LD metadata?

objectives:
- Construct an RO-Crate by hand using JSON
- Describe each part of the Research Object
- Learn basic JSON-LD to create FAIR metadata
- Connect different parts of the Research Object using identifiers

time_estimation:  30M
keypoints:
- RO-Crate provides a structure to make FAIR data packages
- schema.org in JSON-LD provides a controlled vocabulary for FAIR metadata
- Each entity of the crate is described separately
- Cross-references between entities create a graph
- The RO-Crate specification recommends which types and keys to use

## Tutorial walk-through

In this tutorial, meant to be read along with the [RO-Crate specification](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/), we'll walk through the initial steps for creating a basic RO-Crate. You are invited to replicate the below steps on your local computer.
