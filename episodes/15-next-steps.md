## Next steps

You have completed making a basic RO-Crate. You may try any of the following:

- **Add Additional Properties**: Explore the RO-Crate specification for a wide range of properties to describe  [data entities](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2/data-entities.html) more comprehensively.

- **More Contextual Entities**: Discover additional [contextual entities](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2/contextual-entities.html) you can add to your crate, such as projects, grants, or related publications, to enrich the crate's context.

- **Provenance and Software**: Learn how to describe the [provenance](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2/provenance.html) (origin and history) of your data and include information about the [software](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2/workflows.html) and workflows used in your research.

- **RO-Crate Profiles**: Delve into [RO-Crate Profiles](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/profiles.html), which are community-defined content checklists that extend the base specification to meet the specific needs of a domain or data type. Profiles impose conventions and may add domain specific terms/vocabularies, effectively making RO-Crates typed and machine-actionable for specific use cases. Examples include the [Workflow RO-Crate profile](https://about.workflowhub.eu/Workflow-RO-Crate/) used by WorkflowHub and the [Five Safes RO-Crate profile](https://trefx.uk/5s-crate/) for trusted workflow execution in Trusted Research Environments (TREs).

- **FAIR Signposting**: Understand how [FAIR Signposting](https://catalogue.fair-impact.eu/resources/fair-signposting) can be used in combination with RO-Crate to guide machine agents through metadata space. It re-uses existing web standards (HTTP Link headers or HTML `<link>` tags tags) to make machine navigation explicit, helping automated agents locate an object's identifier, data records, and metadata records.

- **Bioschemas**: Explore [Bioschemas](https://bioschemas.org/), a community initiative built on schema.org that defines domain-specific profiles (e.g., Dataset, ComputationalWorkflow, ChemicalSubstance) to add structured metadata to web resources, improving findability and interoperability, particularly in the life sciences.

- **Community and Tools**: Join the open [RO-Crate community](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/community) on GitHub, participate in drop-in sessions, and explore available tools like Crate-O, RO-Crate Playground, and libraries for various programming languages (Python, JavaScript). This active community and the developer-friendly tools are key to RO-Crate's adoption and sustainability.

- **Real-world Use Cases**: Gain inspiration from how RO-Crates are being [used in practice](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/use_cases) across various domains, such as in ELIXIR resources for life sciences, WorkflowHub for computational workflows, for Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELN) provenance, and for packaging earth observation data. RO-Crate enables exchange between services and data repositories, fostering an ecosystem of research infrastructure.
