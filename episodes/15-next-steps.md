## Next steps

You have completed making a basic RO-Crate. You may try any of the following:

- Add and describe additional data entities, adding additional properties for [data entities](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/data-entities.html)
- Follow the RO-Crate specification for additional [contextual entities](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/contextual-entities.html) you can add to the crate
- Try briefly describing [provenance](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/provenance.html) or [software](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/workflows.html) for any additional data entities you have added.
