## Describing the root entity

When describing the [root entity](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/root-data-entity.html#direct-properties-of-the-root-data-entity), the properties generally apply to the whole of the crate. For instance it is a good idea to give a description of why these resources are gathered in a crate, as well as giving the crate a name and license for FAIR reuse and citation.

> ## Add metadata to root entity
> 
> Try to add the `name`, `description` and `datePublished` properties, and for `license` as a cross-reference, use [SPDX](https://spdx.org/licenses/) license list to find the identifier for Creative Commons Zero or another license of your choice:
> 
> > ## Solution
> >
> > ```json
> > {
> >   "@id": "./",
> >   "@type": "Dataset",
> >   "hasPart": [ ],
> >   "name": "Example crate",
> >   "description": "I created this example by following the tutorial",
> >   "datePublished": "2023-05-22T12:03:00+0100",
> >   "license": { "@id": "http://spdx.org/licenses/CC0-1.0"}  
> > }
> > ```

> ## License identifiers
>
> In the above solution, the identifier for CC0-1.0 <http://spdx.org/licenses/CC0-1.0> is slightly 
> different from their listed web page URI <https://spdx.org/licenses/CC0-1.0.html> -- the former 
> is chosen to align with [SPDX JSON-LD identifiers](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data/tree/main/jsonld),
> which unfortunately are not shown directly on their website as _permalinks_. 
> It is not a requirement in RO-Crate to use permalinks for `@id` of entities like licenses, 
> it is nevertheless best practice to propagate permalinks where known.

> ## Choosing a license
>
> Choosing a license appropriate for your dataset can be non-trivial, particularly if third-party data/software and multiple organizations are involved. See [FAIR Cookbook on licensing](https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/content/recipes/reusability/ATI-licensing.html). It is worth noting that an RO-Crate permits data entities to have a `license` different from the overall Crate license. It is still recommended to choose an overall Crate license that can legally apply across all the content in the RO-Crate Root.
