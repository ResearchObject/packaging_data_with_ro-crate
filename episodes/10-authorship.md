## Authorship

Moving back to the RO-Crate root `./`, let's specify who are the authors of the crate.

> ## Add an author and affiliation
>
> 1. Add yourself as an [`author`](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/contextual-entities.html#people) of the crate using the type `Person`
> 2. Include your preferred name. 
> 3. If you don't have an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/), you may use either the URL of your main home page at your institution, or a crate-local identifier like `#alice`.
> 4. Include your `affiliation` as a string value.
> 
> > ## Solution
> > ```json
> > {
> >   "@id": "./",
> >   "@type": "Dataset",
> >   "author": {"@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097"},
> >   "…": "…"
> > },
> > {
> >   "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097",
> >   "@type": "Person", 
> >   "name": "Josiah Carberry",
> >   "affiliation": "Brown University"
> > }
> > ```

> ## Who can be authors of an RO-Crate?
>
> When we say someone is an author of a crate, it means they have contributed something substansively to its content (typically the data). Agreement on what is considered authorship on a dataset can be tricky; you may decide some people would be better represented as `contributor`. One advantage of RO-Crate is that authorship can be declared explicitly also on each data entity, so it can be clearer where each person have contributed (e.g. a statistician is author of an R script).  This means that generally the authors of the crate can be a broader, more inclusive list than perhaps traditionally recognized as academic authorship.

> ## Add an organization
> 
> 1. "Unroll" your `affiliation` of the person as cross-reference to another contextual entity, typed as an `Organization`. 
> 2. You can use [ROR](https://ror.org/) to find an identifier for most educational/research institutions, or you can use the main web page of your organization as its `@id`.
> 
> > ## Solution
> >
> > ```json
> > {
> >   "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097",
> >   "@type": "Person", 
> >   "name": "Josiah Carberry",
> >   "affiliation": {
> >     "@id": "https://ror.org/05gq02987"
> >   }
> > },
> > {
> >   "@id": "https://ror.org/05gq02987",
> >   "@type": "Organization",
> >   "name": "Brown University",
> >   "url": "http://www.brown.edu/"
> > }
> > ```

The reuse of existing identifiers is important for both persons and organization from a FAIR perspective, as their names may not be globally unique.

> ## Specify a publisher
> 
> 1. Now imagine you are going to publish the RO-Crate on your institution's web pages. 
> 2. Cross-reference the same Organization entity with `publisher` from the RO-Crate Root entitity:
> 
> > ## Solution
> >
> > ```json
> > {
> >     "@id": "./",
> >     "@type": "Dataset",
> >     "publisher": {"@id": "https://ror.org/05gq02987"},
> >     "…": "…"
> > }
> > ```
