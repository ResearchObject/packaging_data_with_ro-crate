## Turning a folder into an RO-Crate

In the simplest form, to describe some data on disk, an _RO-Crate Metadata File_ is placed in a folder alongside a set of files or folders. 

First create a new folder `crate1/` and add a single file `data.csv` to represent our dataset:

```
"Date","Minimum temperature (°C)","Maximum temperature (°C)","Rainfall (mm)"
2022-02-01,16.0,28.4,0.6
2022-02-02,16.3,17.2,12.4
```
{: .source}


Next, to turn this folder into an RO-Crate we need to add the _RO-Crate Metadata File_, which has a fixed filename.
Create the file `ro-crate-metadata.json` using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your favourite editor, then add the following JSON:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1/context",
  "@graph": [

  ]
}
```

Your folder should now look like this:

![Folder listing of crate1, including data.csv and ro-crate-metadata.json](../fig/crate1-folders.svg "Any folder can be made into an RO-Crate by adding <code>ro-crate-metadata.json</code>")

The presence of the reserved `ro-crate-metadata.json` filename means that `crate1` (and its children) can now be considered to be an **RO-Crate**. We call the top-level folder of the crate for the **RO-Crate Root** and can now refer to its content with relative file paths.

We also need to make some declaration within the JSON file to turn it into a valid _RO-Crate Metadata Document_, explained in the next session.


## JSON-LD preamble

The preamble of `@context` and `@graph` are JSON-LD structures that help provide global identifiers to the JSON keys and types used in the rest of the RO-Crate document. These will largely map to definitions in the [schema.org](http://schema.org/) vocabulary, which can be used by RO-Crate extensions to provide additional metadata beyond the RO-Crate specifications. It is this feature of JSON-LD that helps make RO-Crate extensible for many different purposes -- this is explored further in the specification's [appendix on JSON-LD](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/appendix/jsonld.html). In short, only JSON keys (_properties_) and types defined this way can be used within the RO-Crate Metadata Document.

However, in the general case it should be sufficient to follow the RO-Crate JSON examples directly without deeper JSON-LD understanding. The RO-Crate Metadata Document contains a flat list of _entities_ as JSON objects in the `@graph` array. These entities are cross-referenced using `@id` identifiers, rather than being deeply nested. This is one major difference from JSON structures you may have experienced before.  The `@type` keyword associates an object with a predefined type from the JSON-LD context. Almost any property can alternatively be used with an `[]` array to provide multiple values.

The rest of this tutorial, and indeed most of the [RO-Crate specification](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/), specify which entities can be added to the `@graph` array.
