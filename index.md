### Target Audience

This tutorial targets researchers and infrastructure managers who are producing file-based datasets. 
The audience will learn the method _RO-Crate_ for publishing such datasets using a pragmatic approach to 
structure and provide FAIR metadata.


### Learning Objectives

- Construct an RO-Crate by hand using JSON
- Describe each part of the Research Object
- Learn basic JSON-LD to create FAIR metadata
- Connect different parts of the Research Object using identifiers
